# ðŸŽ¯Project Name - Gossipia : Gossips uncovered, secrets exposed!

## Basic Details
### Team Name: Hat-trick Hackers

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Harigovind M G -Cochin University College of Engineering Kuttanad,CUSAT

### Project Description
Gossipia is a fun and pointless online platform where users can anonymously share and discover juicy gossip, scandals, and rumors.
It gets stored forever, creating an unchangeable â€œgossip chain". Explore unfiltered submissions, indulge in the latest scoops, and
join the conversation. No holds barred, no secrets kept. Dive into the wild world of gossip. It's just a way to immortalize random, trivial rumors...

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Gossip withdrawal symptoms due to lack of juicy, unverified, and potentially scandalous information

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
- If an anonymous user shares a gossip with a secret code just like a password then he/she can delete it just by using that password
- Submit anonymous gossip (because secrets are too mainstream)
- Unfiltered, uncensored, and utterly unverified (you've been warned)
